# Team Agreement

## The Kerf \- January 27, 2025

# Team Goals and Objectives
The objective is to create a functional cloud 
kerf structure editor which fits the 
specifications given by TAMU HCIED.

# Roles and Responsibilities
The front-end developer will primarily work on the user interface.
The back-end developer will work more on the underlying math and 
shader code since we don't really have a server side to this yet.
CI/CD lead will resolve merge conflicts and test the code.
These are not concrete positions, and anyone can help anywhere where 
help is needed.

# Communication Expectations
We will use a text group chat. 
Before approving merge requests, someone else will review and test the new code.
If someone will not be at class or meetings, communicate ahead of time.

# Meeting Structure and Availability Expectations
We will meet each week after class on Wednesday.

# Change Requests
We will send requests for changes to the project or this
agreement via group chat and vote on said changes.

# Team Agreement Maintenance
This agreement will be maintained via change requests.
