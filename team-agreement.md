# Team Agreement

## The Kerf \- January 27, 2025

# Team Goals and Objectives
The objective is to create a functional cloud 
kerf structure editor which fits the 
specifications given by TAMU HCIED.

# Roles and Responsibilities
The front-end developer will work on the user interface primarily.
The backe-end developer will work more of the underlying math and 
shader code since we don't really have a server side to this yet.

These are not concrete positions, and anyone can help anywhere where 
help is needed.

# Communication Expectations
We will use a text group chat. 

# Meeting Structure and Availability Expectations

# Change Requests

# Team Agreement Maintenance
