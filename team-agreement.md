# Team Agreement

## The Kerf \- January 27, 2025

# Team Goals and Objectives
The objective is to create a functional cloud 
kerf structure editor which fits the 
specifications given by TAMU HCIED.

# Roles and Responsibilities
The front-end developer will primarily work on the user interface.
The back-end developer will work more on the underlying math and 
shader code since we don't really have a server side to this yet.
CI/CD lead will resolve merge conflicts and test the code.
These are not concrete positions, and anyone can help anywhere where 
help is needed.
